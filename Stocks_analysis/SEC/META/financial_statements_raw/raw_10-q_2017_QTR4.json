As a result, we will not proceed with the issuance of the dividend of Class C capital stock.Share Repurchase ProgramIn November 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 billion share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2017, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 7 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $1.04 billion. Share-based Compensation PlansWe maintain two share-based employee compensation plans: the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (2012 Plan) and the 2005 Stock Plan (collectively, Stock Plans). Our 2012 Plan serves as the successor to our 2005 Stock Plan and provides for the issuance of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors and consultants. Outstanding awards under the 2005 Stock Plan continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2005 Stock Plan. Our board of directors approved the amendment and restatement of our 2012 Plan (the Amended 2012 Plan), which was approved by our stockholders and adopted by us in June 2016. We initially reserved 25 million shares of our Class\u00a0A common stock for issuance under our 2012 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term of the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through and including April 2026 unless terminated earlier by our board of directors or a committee thereof, by a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31st or (ii) a number of shares determined by our board of directors. Our board of directors elected not to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance in 2017.

This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years based on vesting under the award service conditions. Included in this unrecognized share-based compensation expense are 16.2 million unvested shares as of September 30, 2017, related to RSU inducement awards granted to two employees in connection with the WhatsApp acquisition in 2014.

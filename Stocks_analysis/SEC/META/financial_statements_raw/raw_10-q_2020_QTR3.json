As of December 31, 2019, $4.90\u00a0billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. In January 2020, an additional $10.0\u00a0billion of repurchases was authorized under this program. During the six months ended June\u00a030, 2020, we repurchased and subsequently retired 13\u00a0million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $2.62\u00a0billion. As of June\u00a030, 2020, $12.28\u00a0billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule\u00a010b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Share-based Compensation PlansWe maintain two share-based employee compensation plans: the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, which was amended in each of June 2016 and February 2018 (Amended 2012 Plan), and the 2005 Stock Plan (collectively, Stock Plans). Our Amended 2012 Plan serves as the successor to our 2005 Stock Plan and provides for the issuance of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors and consultants. Outstanding awards under the 2005 Stock Plan continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2005 Stock Plan. Shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited under our Stock Plans are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan. We account for forfeitures as they occur.Share-based compensation expense consists of our RSU expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period.Effective January 1, 2020, there were 171 million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term of the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026, by a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the immediately preceding December\u00a031st or (ii)\u00a0a number of shares determined by our board of directors.The following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the six months ended June\u00a030, 2020:  \u00a0Unvested RSUs\u00a0Number of Shares\u00a0Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value\u00a0(in thousands)\u00a0\u00a0Unvested at December 31, 201978,851\u00a0$165.74Granted48,395\u00a0$168.66Vested(18,256)\u00a0$158.09Forfeited(2,733)\u00a0$161.28Unvested at June 30, 2020106,257\u00a0$168.49The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the three and six months ended June\u00a030, 2020 was $2.04\u00a0billion and $3.84\u00a0billion, respectively, and $1.58\u00a0billion and $2.89\u00a0billion during the three and six months ended June\u00a030, 2019, respectively.As of June\u00a030, 2020, there was $16.90\u00a0billion of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to RSUs awards.

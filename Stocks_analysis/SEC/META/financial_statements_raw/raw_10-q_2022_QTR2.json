As of December\u00a031, 2021, $38.79\u00a0billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. During the three months ended March\u00a031, 2022, we repurchased and subsequently retired 34\u00a0million shares of our Class\u00a0A common stock for an aggregate amount of $9.39\u00a0billion. As of March\u00a031, 2022, $29.41\u00a0billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule\u00a010b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Share-based Compensation PlansWe have one active share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, which was amended in each of June 2016 and February 2018 (Amended 2012 Plan). Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors, and consultants. Shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited under our stock plan are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan.Effective January\u00a01, 2022, there were 136 million shares of our Class\u00a0A common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan. Pursuant to the automatic increase provision under our Amended 2012 Plan, the number of shares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January\u00a01 of each of the calendar years during the term of the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026, by a number of shares of Class\u00a0A common stock equal to the lesser of (i)\u00a02.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class\u00a0A common stock as of the immediately preceding December\u00a031st or (ii)\u00a0a number of shares determined by our board of directors.

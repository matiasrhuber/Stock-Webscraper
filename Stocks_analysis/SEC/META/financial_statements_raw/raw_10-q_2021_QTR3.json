As of December\u00a031, 2020, $8.60\u00a0billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2021, an additional $25.0\u00a0billion of repurchases was authorized under this program. During the six months ended June\u00a030, 2021, we repurchased and subsequently retired 37\u00a0million shares of our Class\u00a0A common stock for an aggregate amount of $11.26\u00a0billion. As of June\u00a030, 2021, $22.34\u00a0billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule\u00a010b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Share-based Compensation PlansWe maintain one active share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, which was amended in each of June 2016 and February 2018 (Amended 2012 Plan). Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors and consultants. Shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited under our stock plan are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan. We account for forfeitures as they occur.Share-based compensation expense consists of the Company's RSUs expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period.Effective January\u00a01, 2021, there were 145\u00a0million shares of our Class\u00a0A common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan. Pursuant to the automatic increase provision under our Amended 2012 Plan, the number of shares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January\u00a01 of each of the calendar years during the term of the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026, by a number of shares of Class\u00a0A common stock equal to the lesser of (i)\u00a02.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class\u00a0A common stock as of the immediately preceding December\u00a031st or (ii)\u00a0a number of shares determined by our board of directors.The following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the six months ended June\u00a030, 2021:Unvested RSUsNumber of SharesWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value(in thousands)Unvested at December 31, 202096,733\u00a0$181.88\u00a0Granted46,177\u00a0$294.54\u00a0Vested(22,009)$188.28\u00a0Forfeited(6,206)$200.23\u00a0Unvested at June 30, 2021114,695\u00a0$225.01\u00a0The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the three months ended June\u00a030, 2021 and 2020 was $3.65\u00a0billion and $2.04\u00a0billion, respectively, and $6.48\u00a0billion and $3.84\u00a0billion during the six months ended June\u00a030, 2021 and 2020, respectively.As of June\u00a030, 2021, there was $24.48\u00a0billion of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to RSU awards.

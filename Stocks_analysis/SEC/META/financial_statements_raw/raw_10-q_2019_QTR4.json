In December 2018, our board of directors authorized an additional $9.0 billion of repurchases under this program. During the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2019, we repurchased and subsequently retired 15.4 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $2.80 billion. As of September\u00a030, 2019, $6.20 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the share repurchase program depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Share-based Compensation PlansWe maintain two share-based employee compensation plans: the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, which was amended in each of June 2016 and February 2018 (Amended 2012 Plan), and the 2005 Stock Plan (collectively, Stock Plans). Our Amended 2012 Plan serves as the successor to our 2005 Stock Plan and provides for the issuance of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors and consultants. Outstanding awards under the 2005 Stock Plan continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2005 Stock Plan. Shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited under our Stock Plans are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan. We account for forfeitures as they occur.Effective January 1, 2019, there were 143 million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term of the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026 unless terminated earlier by our board of directors or a committee thereof, by a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the immediately preceding December\u00a031st or (ii)\u00a0a number of shares determined by our board of directors.

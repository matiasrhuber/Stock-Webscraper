The Class C capital stock will have the same rights and powers, rank equally (including as to dividends and distributions, mergers or similar business combinations, and in connection with any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the corporation), share ratably and be identical in all other respects and as to all matters to the shares of Class\u00a0A and Class B common stock, except for voting rights and as expressly provided in the New Certificate. The New Certificate was approved by our stockholders on June 20, 2016. As of\u00a0June 30, 2017, the New Certificate was not yet effective.As part of the Reclassification, we announced that our board of directors intends to issue\u00a0two\u00a0shares of the Class C capital stock as a one-time stock dividend for each share of Class\u00a0A and Class B common stock outstanding. The record and payment dates for this dividend will be determined by our board of directors in its discretion and there can be no assurance as to the timing of such dates. For accounting purposes, we expect this dividend will be treated as a stock split in the form of a dividend.Share Repurchase ProgramIn November 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 billion share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. During the six months ended June\u00a030, 2017, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 3 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $408 million. Share-based Compensation PlansWe maintain two share-based employee compensation plans: the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (2012 Plan) and the 2005 Stock Plan (collectively, Stock Plans). Our 2012 Plan serves as the successor to our 2005 Stock Plan and provides for the issuance of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors and consultants. Outstanding awards under the 2005 Stock Plan continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2005 Stock Plan. Our board of directors approved the amendment and restatement of our 2012 Plan (the Amended 2012 Plan), which was approved by our stockholders and adopted by us in June 2016. We initially reserved 25 million shares of our Class\u00a0A common stock for issuance under our 2012 Plan. Following the date of the contemplated stock dividend of Class C capital stock described above, if it is declared and paid, the shares reserved and available for issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan will be shares of the new Class C capital stock, except for shares reserved for awards outstanding immediately prior to the payment of the dividend. The number of shares reserved for issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term of the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through and including April 2026 unless terminated earlier by our board of directors or a committee thereof, by a number of shares of Class C capital stock (and prior to the date of the payment of the stock dividend described above, Class A common stock) equal to the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock as of the immediately preceding December 31st or (ii) a number of shares determined by our board of directors. Our board of directors elected not to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance in 2017.

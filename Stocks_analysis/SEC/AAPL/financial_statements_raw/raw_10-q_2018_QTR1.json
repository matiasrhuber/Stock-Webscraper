The Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule\u00a010b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into accelerated share repurchase arrangements (\u201cASRs\u201d) with financial institutions. In exchange for up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the Company\u2019s common stock during the purchase periods of each ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company\u2019s common stock during that period. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders\u2019 equity in the Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in the periods the payments are made. The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. The ASRs met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and therefore were not accounted for as derivative instruments.The following table shows the Company\u2019s ASR activity and related information during the three months ended December\u00a030, 2017 and the year ended September\u00a030, 2017:\u00a0Purchase PeriodEnd Date\u00a0Number of Shares(in thousands)\u00a0Average RepurchasePrice Per Share\u00a0ASR Amount(in millions)November 2017 ASRFebruary 2018\u00a023,602(1)\u00a0(1)\u00a0\u00a0$5,000August 2017 ASRNovember 2017\u00a018,887(2)\u00a0$158.84\u00a0$3,000May 2017 ASRAugust 2017\u00a020,108\u00a0$149.20\u00a0$3,000February 2017 ASRMay 2017\u00a020,949\u00a0$143.20\u00a0$3,000November 2016 ASRFebruary 2017\u00a051,157\u00a0$117.29\u00a0$6,000August 2016 ASRNovember 2016\u00a026,850\u00a0$111.73\u00a0$3,000(1)\u201cNumber of Shares\u201d represents those shares delivered at the beginning of the purchase period and does not represent the final number of shares to be delivered under the ASR.

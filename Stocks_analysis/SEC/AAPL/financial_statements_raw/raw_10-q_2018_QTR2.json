In exchange for up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the Company\u2019s common stock during the purchase periods of each ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company\u2019s common stock during that period. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders\u2019 equity in the Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in the periods the payments are made. The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. The ASRs met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and therefore were not accounted for as derivative instruments.The following table shows the Company\u2019s ASR activity and related information during the six months ended March\u00a031, 2018 and the year ended September\u00a030, 2017:\u00a0Purchase PeriodEnd Date\u00a0Number of Shares(in thousands)\u00a0Average RepurchasePrice Per Share\u00a0ASR Amount(in millions)November 2017 ASRFebruary 2018\u00a029,269(1)\u00a0$170.84\u00a0$5,000August 2017 ASRNovember 2017\u00a018,887\u00a0$158.84\u00a0$3,000May 2017 ASRAugust 2017\u00a020,108\u00a0$149.20\u00a0$3,000February 2017 ASRMay 2017\u00a020,949\u00a0$143.20\u00a0$3,000November 2016 ASRFebruary 2017\u00a051,157\u00a0$117.29\u00a0$6,000August 2016 ASRNovember 2016\u00a026,850\u00a0$111.73\u00a0$3,000(1)Includes 23.6 million shares delivered and retired at the beginning of the purchase period, which began in the first quarter of 2018, and 5.7 million shares delivered and retired at the end of the purchase period, which concluded in the second quarter of 2018.Additionally, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market, which were retired upon repurchase, during the periods presented as follows:\u00a0Number of Shares(in thousands)\u00a0Average Repurchase Price Per Share\u00a0Amount(in millions)2018:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second quarter137,040\u00a0$171.48\u00a0$23,500First quarter30,181\u00a0$169.26\u00a05,109Total open market common stock repurchases167,221\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$28,609\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02017:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth quarter29,073\u00a0$154.78\u00a0$4,500Third quarter30,356\u00a0$148.24\u00a04,500Second quarter31,070\u00a0$128.74\u00a04,001First quarter44,333\u00a0$112.78\u00a05,000Total open market common stock repurchases134,832\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$18,001On May 1, 2018, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had authorized a new program to repurchase up to $100 billion of the Company\u2019s common stock.

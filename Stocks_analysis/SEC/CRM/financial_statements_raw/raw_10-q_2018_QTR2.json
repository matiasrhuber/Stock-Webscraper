As of April\u00a030, 2018 and January\u00a031, 2018, $150 million and $63 million, respectively, was withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. Prior to February\u00a02006, options issued under the Company\u2019s stock option plans generally had a term of 10 years. From February 1, 2006 through July 2013, options issued had a term of five years. After July 2013, options issued have a term of seven years.The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share:\u00a0Three Months EndedApril 30,Stock Options2018\u00a02017Volatility27.8 - 28%\u00a031.4%Estimated life3.5 years\u00a0\u00a03.5 years\u00a0Risk-free interest rate2.5 - 2.7%\u00a01.4 - 1.5%Weighted-average fair value per share of grants$28.39\u00a0\u00a0$20.63\u00a0The Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights.The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights.ESPP assumptions and the related fair value per share table are disclosed in the three month period in which there is ESPP activity, such as an ESPP purchase. The Company's ESPP allows for two purchases during the year, one during the second quarter and one during the fourth quarter. The estimated life of the ESPP will be based on the\u00a0two\u00a0purchase periods within each offering period. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.During fiscal 2016, the Company granted a performance-based restricted stock unit award to the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and during fiscal 2017, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock unit awards to certain executive officers, including the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company granted additional performance-based restricted stock unit awards to certain employees, including the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to vesting based on a performance-based condition and a service-based condition. At the end of the three-year service period, based on the Company's share price performance, these performance-based restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between 0 and 200%, depending on the extent the performance condition is achieved.

The intrinsic value is the difference between the current market value of the stock and the exercise price of the stock option.The weighted-average remaining contractual life of vested and expected to vest options is approximately 5 years.As of April\u00a030, 2018, options to purchase 10.8 million shares were vested at a weighted average exercise price of $61.29 per share and had a remaining weighted-average contractual life of approximately 4 years. The total intrinsic value of these vested options as of April\u00a030, 2018 was $647 million.During the three months ended April 30, 2018, the Company recognized stock-based expense related to its equity plans for employees and non-employee directors of $252 million. As of April\u00a030, 2018, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was approximately $2.7 billion. The Company will amortize this stock compensation balance as follows: $847 million during the remaining nine months of fiscal 2019; $870 million during fiscal 2020; $612 million during fiscal 2021; $343 million during fiscal 2022; $54 million during fiscal 2023 and $8 million thereafter. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of April\u00a030, 2018 and assumes no forfeiture activity. The aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2 years.

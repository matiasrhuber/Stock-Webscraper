As of January\u00a031, 2019 and January\u00a031, 2018, $76 million and $63 million, respectively, was withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and is recorded in accrued compensation.

Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights.The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights.The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.In fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock unit awards to the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, including the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, respectively. In fiscal 2019, the Company granted additional performance-based restricted stock unit awards to certain employees, including the Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to vesting based on a performance-based condition and a service-based condition. At the end of the three-year service period, based on the Company's share price performance, these performance-based restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between 0 and 200%, depending on the extent the performance condition is achieved.

The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January\u00a031, 2019 and assumes no forfeiture activity.

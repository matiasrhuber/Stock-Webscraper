Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights.The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights.The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.In the first quarter and second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company granted additional performance-based restricted stock unit awards to certain employees, including the Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to vesting based on a performance-based condition and a service-based condition. At the end of the three-year service period, based on the Company's share price performance, these performance-based restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between 0 and 200%, depending on the extent the performance condition is achieved.

The total intrinsic value of these vested options as of July\u00a031, 2018 was $1.0 billion.During the six months ended July 31, 2018, the Company recognized stock-based expense related to its equity plans for employees and non-employee directors of $603 million. As of July\u00a031, 2018, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was approximately $2.9 billion. The Company will amortize this stock compensation balance as follows: $660 million during the remaining six months of fiscal 2019; $1.0 billion during fiscal 2020; $714 million during fiscal 2021; $400 million during fiscal 2022; $67 million during fiscal 2023 and $8 million thereafter. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of July\u00a031, 2018 and assumes no forfeiture activity.

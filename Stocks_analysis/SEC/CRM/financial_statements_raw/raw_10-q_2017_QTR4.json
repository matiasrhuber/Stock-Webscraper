The expiration of the 1999 Stock Option Plan (\u201c1999 Plan\u201d) in fiscal 2010 did not affect awards outstanding, which continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the 1999 Plan. As of October\u00a031, 2017, $119.2 million has been withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. Prior to February\u00a02006, options issued under the Company\u2019s stock option plans generally had a term of 10 years. From February\u00a01, 2006 through July 2013, options issued had a term of five years.

Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights.The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights.ESPP assumptions and the related fair value per share table will only be disclosed in the three month period in which there is ESPP activity, such as an ESPP purchase. The Company's ESPP allows for two purchases during the year, one during the second quarter and one during the fourth quarter. The estimated life of the ESPP will be based on the\u00a0two\u00a0purchase periods within each offering period. The weighted-average fair value per share of grants was $21.13 and $21.93 for the three months ended July 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.During fiscal 2016, the Company granted a performance-based restricted stock unit award to the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and during fiscal 2017, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock unit awards to certain executive officers, including the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to vesting based on a performance-based condition and a service-based condition. At the end of the three-year service period, based on the Company's share price performance, these performance-based restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between 0 and 200%, depending on the extent the performance condition is achieved.

The intrinsic value is the difference between the current market value of the stock and the exercise price of the stock option.The weighted-average remaining contractual life of vested and expected to vest options is approximately 5 years.As of October\u00a031, 2017, options to purchase 10,090,058 shares were vested at a weighted average exercise price of $57.62 per share and had a remaining weighted-average contractual life of approximately 4 years. The total intrinsic value of these vested options as of October\u00a031, 2017 was $451.2 million.During the nine months ended October 31, 2017, the Company recognized stock-based expense related to its equity plans for employees and non-employee directors of $759.3 million. As of October\u00a031, 2017, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was approximately $2.0 billion. The Company will amortize this stock compensation balance as follows: $234.5 million during the remaining three months of fiscal 2018; $777.8 million during fiscal 2019; $574.4 million during fiscal 2020; $303.6 million during fiscal 2021; $42.9 million during fiscal 2022 and $25.2 million thereafter. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of October\u00a031, 2017 and assumes no forfeiture activity. The aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years.

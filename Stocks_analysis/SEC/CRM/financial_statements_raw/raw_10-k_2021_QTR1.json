As of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, $140 million and $107 million, respectively, was withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and recorded as accrued compensation. Shares purchased under the ESPP were approximately 3.9\u00a0million, 3.3\u00a0million and 3.5\u00a0million during fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.Options issued have terms of seven years.The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share:\u00a0Fiscal Year Ended January 31,Stock Options202120202019Volatility28 - 37%27 - 30%27 - 28%Estimated life3.5 years3.5 years3.5 yearsRisk-free interest rate0.2 - 1.4%1.6 - 2.5%2.5 - 3.0%Weighted-average fair value per share of grants$41.24\u00a0$39.59\u00a0$28.89\u00a0\u00a0Fiscal Year Ended January 31,ESPP202120202019Volatility42 - 48%28 - 33%23 - 26%Estimated life0.75 years0.75 years0.75 yearsRisk-free interest rate0.1 - 0.2%1.6 - 2.1%2.0 - 2.6%Weighted-average fair value per share of grants$64.14\u00a0$41.43\u00a0$32.90\u00a0The Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights.The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights.The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.In fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock unit awards to certain employees, including the Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to vesting based on a performance-based condition and a service-based condition. At the end of the three-year service period, based on the Company's share price performance, these performance-based restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between 0 and 200%, depending on the extent the performance condition is achieved.

following stock plans: the ESPP, the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2014 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (\u201c2014 Inducement Plan\u201d). As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, $107 million and $76 million, respectively, was withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and is recorded in accrued compensation. From February 1, 2006 through July 2013, options issued had a term of five years. After July 2013, options issued have a term of seven years.The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share:\u00a0Fiscal Year Ended January 31,Stock Options202020192018Volatility27 - 30%27 - 28%28 - 31%Estimated life3.5 years3.5 years3.5 yearsRisk-free interest rate1.6 - 2.5%2.5 - 3.0%1.4 - 2.3%Weighted-average fair value per share of grants$39.59\u00a0\u00a0$28.89\u00a0\u00a0$22.71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fiscal Year Ended January 31,ESPP202020192018Volatility28 - 33%23 - 26%\u00a0\u00a021 - 28%Estimated life0.75 years0.75 years0.75 yearsRisk-free interest rate1.6 - 2.1%2.0 - 2.6%1.1 - 1.7%Weighted-average fair value per share of grants$41.43\u00a0\u00a0$32.90\u00a0\u00a0$23.64\u00a0\u00a0The Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights.The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights.The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.In fiscal 2020 and 2019, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock unit awards to certain employees, including the Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to vesting based on a performance-based condition and a service-based condition. At the end of the three-year service period, based on the Company's share price performance, these performance-based restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between 0 and 200%, depending on the extent the performance condition is achieved.

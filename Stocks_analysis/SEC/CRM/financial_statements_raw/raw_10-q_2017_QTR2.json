The expiration of the 1999 Stock Option Plan (\u201c1999 Plan\u201d) in fiscal 2010 did not affect awards outstanding, which continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the 1999 Plan. As of April\u00a030, 2017, $115.6 million has been withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. Prior to February\u00a02006, options issued under the Company\u2019s stock option plans generally had a term of 10 years. From February\u00a01, 2006 through July 2013, options issued had a term of five years. After July 2013, options issued have a term of seven years.The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share:\u00a0\u00a0Three Months Ended\u00a0April 30,Stock Options2017\u00a02016Volatility31.4%\u00a032.1%Estimated life3.5 years\u00a0\u00a03.5 years\u00a0Risk-free interest rate1.4 - 1.5%\u00a00.9 - 1.0%Weighted-average fair value per share of grants$20.63\u00a0\u00a0$17.35\u00a0The Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights. The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights.The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.During fiscal 2016, the Company granted a performance-based restricted stock unit award to the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and during fiscal 2017, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock unit awards to certain executive officers, including the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to vesting based on a performance-based condition and a service-based condition.   At the end of the three year service period, based on the Company's share price performance, these performance-based restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between 0 and 200%, depending on the extent the performance condition is achieved.

As of April\u00a030, 2017, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was approximately $2.4 billion. The Company will amortize this stock compensation balance as follows: $769.4 million during the remaining nine months of fiscal 2018; $772.2 million during fiscal 2019; $554.5 million during fiscal 2020; $270.4 million during fiscal 2021; $20.3 million during fiscal 2022 and $25.2 million thereafter. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of April\u00a030, 2017 and assumes no forfeiture activity.

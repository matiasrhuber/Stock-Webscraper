Share Repurchase ProgramIn August 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0\u00a0billion of the Company\u2019s common stock (the \u201cShare Repurchase Program\u201d). The Share Repurchase Program does not have a fixed expiration date and does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Share Repurchase Program, shares of common stock may be repurchased using a variety of methods, including privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), as part of accelerated share repurchases and other methods. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases are determined by the Company in its discretion and depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method.During three months ended October 31, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately 11\u00a0million shares of its common stock for approximately $1.7\u00a0billion at an average price per share of $152.66. All repurchases were made in open market transactions.

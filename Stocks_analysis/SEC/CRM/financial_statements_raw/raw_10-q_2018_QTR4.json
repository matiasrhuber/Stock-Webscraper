As of October\u00a031, 2018 and January\u00a031, 2018, $145 million and $63 million, respectively, was withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. From February 1, 2006 through July 2013, options issued had a term of five years. After July 2013, options issued have a term of seven years.The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share:\u00a0Three Months EndedOctober 31,\u00a0Nine Months EndedOctober 31,Stock Options2018\u00a02017\u00a02018\u00a02017Volatility27.0 - 27.8%\u00a030.8%\u00a027.0 - 28.0%\u00a030.8 - 31.4%Estimated life3.5 years\u00a0\u00a03.5 years\u00a0\u00a03.5 years\u00a0\u00a03.5 years\u00a0Risk-free interest rate2.7 - 3.0%\u00a01.6 - 1.8%\u00a02.5 - 3.0%\u00a01.4 - 1.8%Weighted-average fair value per share of grants$35.44\u00a0\u00a0$24.12\u00a0\u00a0$28.84\u00a0\u00a0$22.26\u00a0The Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights.The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights.ESPP assumptions and the related fair value per share table are disclosed in the three month period in which there is ESPP activity, such as an ESPP purchase. The Company's ESPP allows for\u00a0two\u00a0purchases during the year, one during the second quarter and one during the fourth quarter. The estimated life of the ESPP will be based on the\u00a0two\u00a0purchase periods within each offering period.The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.In the first quarter and second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company granted additional performance-based restricted stock unit awards to certain employees, including the Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to vesting based on a performance-based condition and a service-based condition. At the end of the three-year service period, based on the Company's share price performance, these performance-based restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between 0 and 200%, depending on the extent the performance condition is achieved.

The intrinsic value is the difference between the current market value of the stock and the exercise price of the stock option.The weighted-average remaining contractual life of vested and expected to vest options is approximately 5 years.As of October\u00a031, 2018, options to purchase 12 million shares were vested at a weighted average exercise price of $54.28 per share and had a remaining weighted-average contractual life of approximately 4 years. The total intrinsic value of these vested options as of October\u00a031, 2018 was $1.0 billion.During the nine months ended October 31, 2018, the Company recognized stock-based expense related to its equity plans for employees and non-employee directors of $954 million. As of October\u00a031, 2018, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was approximately $2.7 billion. The Company will amortize this stock compensation balance as follows: $323 million during the remaining three months of fiscal 2019; $1.1 billion during fiscal 2020; $755 million during fiscal 2021; $436 million during fiscal 2022; $87 million during fiscal 2023 and $8 million thereafter. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of October\u00a031, 2018 and assumes no forfeiture activity. The aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2 years.The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding as of October\u00a031, 2018:\u00a0\u00a0Options Outstanding\u00a0Options ExercisableRange of ExercisePrices\u00a0NumberOutstanding(in thousands)\u00a0Weighted-AverageRemainingContractual\u00a0Life(Years)\u00a0Weighted-AverageExercisePrice\u00a0Number ofShares(in thousands)\u00a0Weighted-AverageExercisePrice$0.30 to $19.78\u00a04,040\u00a06.6\u00a0$11.56\u00a02,271\u00a0$8.91$21.41 to $59.34\u00a06,507\u00a03.3\u00a052.99\u00a05,981\u00a054.39$59.37 to $75.01\u00a01,062\u00a05.6\u00a068.47\u00a0418\u00a070.77$75.57\u00a04,079\u00a05.1\u00a075.57\u00a01,450\u00a075.57$76.48 to $82.08\u00a03,796\u00a04.2\u00a080.86\u00a02,206\u00a080.87$82.55 to $114.13\u00a0971\u00a05.9\u00a097.88\u00a0155\u00a092.72$118.04 to $155.52\u00a06,484\u00a06.4\u00a0119.95\u00a00\u00a00.00\u00a0\u00a026,939\u00a05.1\u00a0$72.47\u00a012,481\u00a0$54.28Restricted stock activity is as follows:\u00a0Restricted Stock\u00a0Outstanding\u00a0Outstanding(in thousands)\u00a0Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value\u00a0AggregateIntrinsicValue (in millions)Balance as of January 31, 201819,018\u00a0$77.85\u00a0\u00a0Granted - restricted stock units and awards11,490\u00a0121.97\u00a0\u00a0Granted - performance-based stock units453\u00a0118.59\u00a0\u00a0Canceled(1,571)\u00a089.93\u00a0\u00a0Vested and converted to shares(6,313)\u00a076.20\u00a0\u00a0Balance as of October 31, 201823,077\u00a0$100.27\u00a0$3,167Expected to vest19,968\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$2,740The restricted stock, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each share of restricted stock, has an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of the Company\u2019s common stock, and generally vests over four years.

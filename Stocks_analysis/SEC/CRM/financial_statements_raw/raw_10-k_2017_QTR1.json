The expiration of the 1999 Stock Option Plan (\u201c1999 Plan\u201d) in fiscal 2010 did not affect awards outstanding, which continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the 1999 Plan.On July 10, 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Inducement Plan with a reserve of 335,000 shares of common stock for future issuance solely for the granting of inducement stock options and equity awards to new employees, including employees of acquired companies. In addition, approximately 319,000 shares of common stock that remained available for grant under the 2006 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201cPrior Inducement Plan\u201d) as of July 9, 2014 were added to the 2014 Inducement Plan share reserve and the Prior Inducement Plan was terminated. Further, any shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Inducement Plan that expire, are forfeited, or are repurchased by the Company will also become available for future grant under the 2014 Inducement Plan. Termination of the Prior Inducement Plan did not affect the outstanding awards previously issued thereunder. The 2014 Inducement Plan was adopted without stockholder approval in reliance on the \u201cemployment inducement exemption\u201d provided under the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual. In September 2011, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors amended and restated the ESPP. In conjunction with the amendment of the ESPP, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors determined that the offerings under the ESPP would commence, beginning with a twelve month offering period starting in December 2011. As of January\u00a031, 2017, $48.4 million has been withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. Employees purchased 3.2 million shares for $126.1 million and 3.0 million shares for $155.0 million, in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, under the ESPP.Prior to February\u00a01, 2006, options issued under the Company\u2019s stock option plans generally had a term of 10 years.

After July\u00a03, 2013, options issued have a term of seven years years.The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fiscal Year Ended January 31,\u00a0\u00a0Stock Options\u00a02017\u00a0\u00a02016\u00a0\u00a02015\u00a0\u00a0Volatility\u00a031.4 -32.3%\u00a032-37%\u00a037%\u00a0Estimated life\u00a03.5 years\u00a0\u00a03.5 years\u00a0\u00a03.6 years\u00a0\u00a0Risk-free interest rate\u00a00.89-1.55%%\u00a01.09-1.42%\u00a01.12-1.53%\u00a0Weighted-average fair value per share of grants\u00a0$19.13\u00a0\u00a0$20.22\u00a0\u00a0$17.20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fiscal Year Ended January 31,\u00a0\u00a0ESPP\u00a02017\u00a0\u00a02016\u00a0\u00a02015\u00a0\u00a0Volatility\u00a028.2-35.2%\u00a030-34%\u00a032-35%\u00a0Estimated life\u00a00.75 years\u00a0\u00a00.75 years\u00a0\u00a00.75 years\u00a0\u00a0Risk-free interest rate\u00a00.47-0.98%\u00a00.06-0.76%\u00a00.07-0.23%\u00a0Weighted-average fair value per share of grants\u00a0$20.18\u00a0\u00a0$19.49\u00a0\u00a0$14.56\u00a0\u00a0The Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights. The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The estimated life of the ESPP was based on the two purchase periods within each offering period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights.The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.During fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock unit awards to the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer as well as to other executive officers subject to vesting based on a performance-based condition and a service-based condition. These performance-based restricted stock units will vest simultaneously if the performance condition is achieved.

The intrinsic value is the difference between the current market value of the stock and the exercise price of the stock option.The weighted-average remaining contractual life of vested and expected to vest options is approximately 5.2 years.As of January\u00a031, 2017, options to purchase 12,180,819 shares were vested at a weighted average exercise price of $49.82 per share and had a remaining weighted-average contractual life of approximately 4.1 years. The total intrinsic value of these vested options as of January\u00a031, 2017 was $359.6 million.During fiscal 2017, the Company recognized stock-based expense of $820.4 million. As of January\u00a031, 2017, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $2.6 billion. It is expected that this stock compensation balance will be amortized as follows: $980.5 million during fiscal 2018; $762.9 million during fiscal 2019; $540.5 million during fiscal 2020; $249.7 million during fiscal 2021; $17.4 million during fiscal 2022; $17.2 million during fiscal 2023; $8.0 million during fiscal 2024. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January\u00a031, 2017 and assumes no forfeiture activity. The aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1 years.The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding as of January\u00a031, 2017:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Options Outstanding\u00a0Options ExercisableRange of ExercisePrices\u00a0NumberOutstanding\u00a0Weighted-AverageRemainingContractual\u00a0Life(Years)\u00a0Weighted-AverageExercisePrice\u00a0Number ofShares\u00a0Weighted-AverageExercisePrice$0.86 to $39.09\u00a05,365,871\u00a04.4\u00a0$21.83\u00a03,937,735\u00a0$26.53$40.19 to $54.36\u00a04,296,003\u00a03.8\u00a051.78\u00a03,082,048\u00a051.62$52.22 to $58.86\u00a0557,788\u00a04.6\u00a057.05\u00a0295,043\u00a056.97$59.34 \u00a05,707,488\u00a04.8\u00a059.34\u00a02,895,013\u00a059.34$59.37 to $75.01\u00a02,164,797\u00a05.8\u00a068.85\u00a0396,998\u00a068.69$75.57 \u00a06,106,407\u00a06.8\u00a075.57\u00a00\u00a00.00$76.48 to $82.55\u00a06,154,722\u00a05.9\u00a080.75\u00a01,573,982\u00a080.95\u00a0\u00a030,353,076\u00a05.3\u00a0$59.88\u00a012,180,819\u00a0$49.82Restricted stock activity is as follows:\u00a0\u00a0Restricted Stock\u00a0Outstanding\u00a0Outstanding\u00a0Weighted-AverageExercise\u00a0Price\u00a0AggregateIntrinsicValue(in thousands)Balance as of January 31, 201523,144,008\u00a0$0.001\u00a0\u00a0Granted- restricted stock units and awards9,736,623\u00a00.001\u00a0\u00a0Granted- performance stock units191,382\u00a00.001\u00a0\u00a0Canceled(2,715,332)\u00a00.001\u00a0\u00a0Vested and converted to shares(9,062,096)\u00a00.001\u00a0\u00a0Balance as of January 31, 201621,294,585\u00a0$0.001\u00a0\u00a0Granted- restricted stock units and awards16,392,948\u00a00.001\u00a0\u00a0Granted- performance stock units208,711\u00a00.001\u00a0\u00a0Canceled(2,017,842)\u00a00.001\u00a0\u00a0Vested and converted to shares(8,424,904)\u00a00.001\u00a0\u00a0Balance as of January 31, 201727,453,498\u00a0$0.001\u00a0$2,171,572Expected to vest22,960,255\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$1,816,156The restricted stock, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each share of restricted stock, has an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of the Company\u2019s common stock, and generally vests over 4 years.The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted stock issued for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $75.99, $73.61 and $58.89, respectively.Common StockThe following number of shares of common stock were reserved and available for future issuance at January\u00a031, 2017:\u00a0Options outstanding30,353,076Restricted stock awards and units and performance stock units outstanding27,453,498Stock available for future grant:\u00a02013 Equity Incentive Plan15,987,9512014 Inducement Plan461,465Amended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan3,663,369Assumed Equity Plans82,406Convertible senior notes17,308,880Warrants17,308,880\u00a0112,619,525During fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, certain board members received stock grants totaling 62,632 shares of common stock, 67,041 shares of common stock and 83,127 shares of common stock, respectively for board services pursuant to the terms described in the 2013 Plan and previously, the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan.

The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. The ability to issue preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control.

Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights.The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights.The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock unit awards to certain employees, including the Chair of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer, the Vice Chair of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to vesting based on a market-based condition and a service-based condition. At the end of the three-year service period, based on the Company's share price performance, these performance-based restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between 0 and 200 percent, depending on the extent the performance condition is achieved.

The intrinsic value of options exercised during each year is calculated as the difference between the market value of the stock at the time of exercise and the exercise price of the stock option.

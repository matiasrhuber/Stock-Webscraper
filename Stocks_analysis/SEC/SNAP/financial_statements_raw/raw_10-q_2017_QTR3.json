In January 2017, our board of directors adopted the 2017 Plan, and in February 2017 our stockholders approved the 2017 Plan, effective on March 1, 2017, which serves as the successor to the 2014 Plan and 2012 Plan and provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees, including employees of any parent or subsidiary, and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other forms of stock awards to employees, directors, and consultants, including employees and consultants of our affiliates. We do not expect to grant any additional awards under the 2014 Plan or 2012 Plan as of the effective date of the 2017 Plan, other than awards for up to 2,500,000 shares of Class A common stock to our employees and consultants in France under the 2014 Plan.

Total unrecognized compensation cost related to Post-2017 RSUs was $597.4 million as of June\u00a030, 2017 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 5.3 years. The service condition is generally satisfied over four years, 10% after the first year of service, 20% over the second year, 30% over the third year, and 40% over the fourth year. In limited instances, we have issued Post-2017 RSUs with vesting periods in excess of four years.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2017, for RSUs issued to employees, we withheld 12.3 million shares of common stock (\u201cnet settlement\u201d) and remitted $208.4 million in cash to meet the related tax withholding requirements on behalf of our employees. In July 2017, we withheld an additional 7.8 million shares of common stock and remitted approximately $105.0 million in cash to satisfy the related tax withholding requirements on behalf of our employees. We will continue to evaluate the net settlement of RSUs that vest in the future. \nThe table below presents stock option awards that entitle the holder to an additional share of Class A common stock on exercise.

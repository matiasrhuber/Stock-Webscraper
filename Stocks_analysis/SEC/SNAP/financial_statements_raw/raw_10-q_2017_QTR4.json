In January 2017, our board of directors adopted the 2017 Plan, and in February 2017 our stockholders approved the 2017 Plan, effective on March 1, 2017, which serves as the successor to the 2014 Plan and 2012 Plan and provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees, including employees of any parent or subsidiary, and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other forms of stock awards to employees, directors, and consultants, including employees and consultants of our affiliates. We do not expect to grant any additional awards under the 2014 Plan or 2012 Plan as of the effective date of the 2017 Plan, other than awards for up to 2,500,000 shares of Class A common stock to our employees and consultants in France under the 2014 Plan. Outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan and 2012 Plan continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2014 Plan and 2012 Plan, respectively. Shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan and 2012 Plan, which were reserved but not issued or subject to outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan or 2012 Plan, respectively, as of the effective date of the 2017 Plan, were added to the reserves of the 2017 Plan. \nWe have initially reserved 87,270,108 shares of our Class\u00a0A common stock for future issuance under the 2017 Plan. An additional number of shares of Class A common stock will be added to the 2017 Plan equal to (i)\u00a096,993,064 shares of Class\u00a0A common stock reserved for future issuance pursuant to outstanding stock options and unvested RSUs under the 2014 Plan, (ii)\u00a037,228,865 shares of Class\u00a0A common stock issuable on conversion of Class B common stock underlying stock options and unvested RSUs outstanding the 2012 Plan, (iii)\u00a017,858,235 shares of Class\u00a0A common stock that were reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan as of the date the 2017 Plan became effective, (iv)\u00a011,004,580 shares of Class\u00a0A common stock issuable on conversion Class B common stock that were reserved for issuance under the 2012 Plan as of the date the 2017 Plan became effective, and (v)\u00a0a maximum of 86,737,997 shares of Class\u00a0A common stock that will be added pursuant to the following sentence. With respect to each share that returns to the 2017 Plan pursuant to (i)\u00a0and (ii)\u00a0of the prior sentence that was associated with an award that was outstanding under the 2014 Plan and 2012 Plan as of October\u00a031, 2016, an additional share of Class\u00a0A common stock will be added to the share reserve of the 2017 Plan, up to a maximum of 86,737,997 shares.

The maximum term for stock options granted under the 2017 Plan may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The 2017 Plan will terminate ten years from the date our board of directors approved the plan, unless it is terminated earlier by our board of directors.\nIn July 2017, we acquired Placed, Inc. (\u201cPlaced\u201d), an advertising measurement services company. See Note 4 for additional information. In connection with the Placed acquisition, we assumed the outstanding stock options under Placed, Inc.\u2019s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended.

The service condition is generally satisfied over four years, 10% after the first year of service, 20% over the second year, 30% over the third year, and 40% over the fourth year. In limited instances, we have issued Post-2017 RSUs with vesting periods in excess of four years.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2017, for RSUs issued to employees, we withheld 23.8 million shares of common stock (\u201cnet settlement\u201d) and remitted $370.9 million in cash to meet the related tax withholding requirements on behalf of our employees. We will continue to evaluate the net settlement of RSUs that vest in the future.\nThe table below presents stock option awards that entitle the holder to an additional share of Class A common stock on exercise.
